# Sunflower Visualization in Flutter

This project creates a dynamic visualization of a sunflower pattern using Flutter. It combines mathematical principles with Flutter's powerful UI and animation capabilities to create an interactive and visually appealing application.


## Features

- **Interactive Seed Adjustment**: Use the slider to dynamically change the number of seeds displayed, from 1 to 250.
- **Smooth Animations**: Each seed transitions smoothly to its new position, creating an organic and dynamic effect.
- **Phyllotaxis Pattern**: The arrangement of seeds follows the principles of phyllotaxis, mimicking the natural patterns found in sunflowers.
